            <h2>About National Museum of Fine Arts</h2>
            <p>The National Museum of Natural History houses 12 permanent galleries that exhibit the rich biological and</p>
            <p>geological diversity of the Philippines. It includes creatively curated displays of botanical, and geological specimens that represent our unique natural history.</p>
            <p>Situated at the center of the museum is a “Tree of Life” structure that proudly connects all the unique ecosystems in the Philippines,</p>
            <p>from our magnificent mountain ridges to the outstanding marine reefs. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In retrospect, the National Museum of Natural History focuses on the biodiversity</p>
            <p>and ecosystem of the Philippines. The exhibits are mostly taxidermized animals that are local to our country in a bid to preserve seemingly lost treasures. </p>
            <p>The usual suspects such as the Philippine eagle and a real-life replica of Lolong, the largest saltwater crocodile in captivity, can be found here.</p>
